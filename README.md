# Marking Country; a Research Centre for Deep History (ANU) project

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

**Note**: You'll need to have access to GSAP Club plugins to install them via npm or their zipped folder of plugins for either dev or build modes.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The dependencies need to have been installed with `npm install`.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
