				`<h2>Why?</h2>
		<h3>Mapping Australia: visualizing British sovereignty</h3>
			<p>Maps are a powerful tool for representing national histories.</p>

			<p>
				In memorable images, maps make authoritative statements about nation, empire, and about the
				past and present.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Marking Country</em> aims to speak back to the dominant ways that Australia has been
				visualised. <em>Marking Country</em>
				demonstrates how the continent of Australia has long been documented in vivid detail, uniting layers
				of storied time and the people of deep history.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yet, for much of the twentieth century and beyond, in the nation's classrooms, on walls and in
				text-books, maps of Australia glorified British expansion, colonial domination and the
				achievements of white Australia. Featuring the one-off journeys of European ocean navigators
				and cross-country explorers, these maps reinforced a European discovery story.
			</p>

			<p>
				They ignored Aboriginal knowledge of land, deep history narratives of ancestral journeys and
				songlines. Rather, they naturalized British imperial sovereignty, and reinforced the European
				ideas of discovery and terra nullius used to justify entitlement to the lands of Indigenous
				nations. These maps superimposed European and colonial stories on an already intricately
				storied land.

	<p>
		This is a history that extends far beyond the two and a half centuries since the arrival of
		British ships from the northern hemisphere.

	<p>
		Indigenous ways of knowing Country have been practiced for millenniaâby some estimates at least
		65,000 years. This everywhen is alive and lived today.

	<h2>Research Centre for Deep History</h2>

	<p>
		The Research Centre for Deep History is on the unceded lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri
		peoples, in the School of History, Australian National University. It builds on the Australian
		Research Council-funded Laureate program
		<strong>
			'Rediscovering the Deep Human Past: Global Networks, Future Opportunities' (FL170100121)
		</strong>
		.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our research aims to expand history's time scale and scope. That is, history as understood by
		the Australian nation, and history as it is understood in schools and universities.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Centre consists of a team of senior and early career researchers, postgraduate students,
		project team members, collaborating scholars, collaborating partner institutions, both
		international and national, and a large network of interested people from Indigenous and
		non-Indigenous backgrounds.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are guided by two
		<a href="https://re.anu.edu.au/advisory-committees"> advisory committees </a>
		, an Indigenous Advisory Committee and a General Advisory Committee, and by the Elders, cultural
		advisers, and community members we work with.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Research Centre for Deep History aims to expand understandings of the practice of history
		and how it is seen and experienced. We are guided by the principles and research protocols
		developed by Indigenous Intellectual Property lawyer Terri Janke.

	<p>
		Indigenous performances of stories, song, dance and artistic practicesâof marking Countryâextend
		over an exceptionally long span of time and with a depth of understanding that we refer to as
		<em>deep history</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our team is committed to working alongside and learning from Indigenous practitioners of
		history. We are inspired by Indigenous ways of thinking about time, and by peopleâs kinship with
		Country.
	</p>
	<p>
		In doing so, we commit to community-collaborative research which includes the following
		guidelines and aims:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Rediscover</strong> - as researchers, we are not seeing anything for the first time; we are
		not 'discovering' something as such. Rather, we are revisiting pasts that were lived and that remain
		alive in Country today.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Return</strong> - we return archival knowledge to communities and reciprocate in ways that
		have real value to Indigenous communities.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Repatriate</strong> - we repatriate knowledge back to Indigenous communities to ensure they
		retain ownership of their stories.
