		This is a digital story from Marardda about travelling on Ngarinyin Country, the signs and
		pathways put down by Wandjina, key sites in the area including Walarda Mindi (Mount Hart
		Station), and the important Wurdu smoking ceremony for babies. It includes an interactive map, a
		short film about Wurdu, and a short film about Durdu-ngardiâ€”the place where the catfish go round

	<p>
		Stories from Marardda are spoken, shared and enacted by Ngarinyin Traditional Owners Phillip
		Duckhole, Matthew Dembal Martin, Chloe Nulgit and Pansy Nulgit. Marardda is a Dambun or clan
		homeland. It is one of over 60 Dambuns belonging to Ngarinyin speaking people, who belong to
		Wandjina Wunggudd culture in the Kimberley. Every person belongs to a Dambun and each person has
		their Wunggudd place in their Country where their spirit was created and where they will return
		when they die.

		The Country is inland, and is made up of vast ranges and rivers dotted with permanent
		waterholes. Marardda also includes the areas where saltwater turns to freshwater and major
		rivers flow to the coast into Walcott Inlet. Every aspect of Country is connected to Wandjina
		creation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ngarinyin Elder David Mowaljarlai spoke in 1974 about the human and creative histories evidenced
		in geological marks on Country, and on the notion of long long time "when the land was soft."
		His words reflect the ever-present connectedness and lack of distancing in time between the
		formation of the earth and human activity in shaping the Wandjina Wunggudd landscape.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Listen to</strong> David Mowaljarlai:</p>

	<AudioBlock source={davidMowaljarlai} summary="Audio transcript">
		<p>
			They're all kneeling down like that see. All their handprints are there on that rock, all
			their knee and their foot. I think when the land was soft, I think, long long time, when it
			was soft. These stones were soft before they get hard, that's the time. (David Mowaljarlai
			1974, recorded by Michael Edols)

		Travelling on Country, Jalala put there by the Wandjina are a sign there is something

			Jalala is a sign. You see a rock standing, shaped like a sign. Any sign you see. See the sign
			of rock standing up on the edge. You know there's something there. It's about Wunggudd sign,
			Wandjina sign. It's a sign for something in that area. So you walk there, you'll find that
			thing you're looking for. Wandjina you'll find them in a cave. You look for Wunggudd you'll
			find a water. That's a Jalala. It's like a signpost saying "It's there."

		Most Ngarinyin people live in communities along the Gibb River Road on or near their Country, or
		at Mowanjum Community outside Derby. Ngarinyin men, women and children became the skilled and
		hard-working backbone of every post colonisation enterprise in their area, especially on the
		pastoral leases.
	</p>

	<p>
		They have rarely been separated from their Country and those people living in towns travel
		constantly to communities on Country. Their successful Native Title claim in 2004 gave them
		exclusive possession over 65,000 square kilometres of land and waters. Whether at Mowanjum,
		Derby or the communities on Country, Ngarinyin language and culture continue to be practiced.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sherika Duckhole, Wurdu project community researcher and language adviser, was brought up on her
		Country surrounded by family. After discussion with her parents Chloe Nulgit and Phillip
		Duckhole, her grandmother Pansy Nulgit, and cultural leader Matthew Dembal Martin, Sherika
		suggested that community members and the research and recording team travel to Marardda, her
		family's Dambun, to Wurdu their babies.

	<h2>Wurdu</h2>

	<p>Wurdu also comes from the Wandjina. Sherika Duckhole describes Wurdu:</p>

	<QuoteInline credit="Sherika Duckhole.">
		<p>
			Wurdu makes them remember the rules and commands that they have to take during their life â€¦
			It's giving them that knowledge in life that they have to go through and what they have to do
			when they're older.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wurdu has been passed down to generations about how we, baby and children growing up be
			respected and respect each other, and how to share and give what we can, when we can â€¦ Wurdu
			is sort of like the Ten Commandments. It's sort of a blessing the Wandjina gave us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wurdu is a smoking ceremony. There's two or three stages; when you are a baby when you're
			about six months old, then about a year, and about three or four years. You smoke with special
			wood, special grass, and also Jalagu (algae). And as they're growing older they just Wurdu
			with the Guru (cypress pine) or the Gunjurla (Conkaberry tree). Our grandparents or great
			grandparents, great aunt or great uncle, will be the ones doing the Wurdu for the family.

		This film shows Matthew Dembal Martin and Chloe Nulgit, senior Ngarinyin men and women doing a

		laws to be a strong, respectful and a responsible member of Ngarinyin culture. Matthew adds that
		when he grows up he will run like an emu. They finish by tapping gently and rythmically on his
		forehead, instructing him to always remember Wurdu.

		A short film spoken by senior Ngarinyin traditional owners about the journey to Durdu-ngardi,
		the catfish story place, edited from recordings made at Marardda (Mount Hart Station). Made by
		Ngarinyin people in their own Country, the film tells the story of the Wandjinas' placement of a
		catfish only in this one place; he never leaves, he just goes round and round. Matthew Dembal
		Martin and Pansy Nulgit lead us to the site and point out the Jalala signs on Country that show
		where the stories live. Senior songman Matthew Dembal Martin sings the Durdu-ngardi song.

<Collapsible name="collapsibleMaking" label="Making Stories from Marardda">
	<p>
		Stories from Marardda was developed over 18 months as a collaboration between Mowanjum
		Aboriginal Art & Culture Centre and the Research Centre for Deep History (Australian National
		University), led by Professor Ann McGrath. The Mowanjum project contributes to the Centre's
		Marking Country initiative, which is creating a national website of Indigenous stories that lead
		to a better understanding of deep histories of Australia and challenge the idea that Australian
		history started in 1788.
	</p>
	<p>
		There were four visits by researchers to the community in Derby in 2021 and 2022. The COVID
		pandemic and restrictions on entry to Western Australia created delays. The first two visits
		were undertaken by the Mowanjum project lead researcher, historian Mary Anne Jebb, who has long
		association with Mowanjum Art Centre and many Ngarinyin families. These visits introduced the
		project aims and possibilities for collaboration and identified who would be involved. Critical
		roles were identified: Community Researcher and Language Adviser and Elders.
	</p>
	<p>
		Key elements of the collaborative relationship were that the community would record their
		cultural knowledge and histories, own their recordings, and produce something of high quality
		that was co-curated by their Community Researcher, reviewed by Elders, and shared with their
		permission. In return the Research Centre for Deep History and the Australian Research Council's
		Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate provided funding to support recording on Country, fees for
		participants, a professional cameraperson, IT resources for website development, and a training
		workshop to co-curate the website.
	</p>
	<p>
		The focus for recording was the Wurdu smoking ceremony for babies. This followed previous
		discussions with Yorna Woolagoodja (Woddordda) who had told Mary Anne Jebb that the community
		exhibition space at Mowanjum Art Centre was missing a crucial element for future generations:
		Wudoo (Woddordda, or Wurdu in Ngarinyin). Ngarinyin Community Researcher and Language Adviser
		Sherika Duckhole is a Mowanjum Museum arts worker and has experience curating exhibitions and
		creating content for exhibitions. She provided advice on where to record, who might participate,
		and on language. She also co-curated this digital story.
	</p>
	<p>
		The three-day recording camp on Country at Walarda Mindi (Mount Hart Station) involved about
		twenty people. Rangers from the Willinggin Aboriginal Corporation also attended the recording
		camp to assist the Traditional Owners who wished to record at Durdu-ngardi (catfish) waterhole,
		Barker Pool. High quality film and sound recordings were made with six individuals and two
		smoking ceremonies, and of the telling of the Durdu-ngardi story. Two edited films of these
		events, along with three additional edited films containing interviews with individuals, and
		collected sound recordings and photographs, were created, with copies returned to the community.
		Individuals directed where their material would be archived.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following people participated: Clintisha Bangmorro, Rona Charles, Phillip Duckhole, Sherika
		Duckhole, Roseanna Mungulu, Maitland Ngerdu, Chloe Nulgit, Emilio Nulgit, Matthew Dembal Martin,
		Cassita Ngerdu, Lexann Oobagooma, Pansy Nulgit Tahlia Taylor, Heather Wungundin.
